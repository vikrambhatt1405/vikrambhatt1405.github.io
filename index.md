Hi, I am a post graduate student at Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Scicences.I write about deep learning(as a practioner point of view), scalable data systems, analytics, and my research work. You can find tutorials of various topics.

During my stay in IISc, I have finished following courses(not necessarily in chronological order).

- Machine Learning with Large Datasets
- Machine Learning for Signal Processing
- Introduction to Scalable Systems
- Multigrid Methods
- Finite Elements, Methods and Applications
- Analysis-I
- Natural Language Understanding
- Scalable System for Data Scicences
- Numerical Linear Algebra
- Modeling and Simulation
- Numerical Methods

- Topics in TensorFlow

  - [Protocol Buffers](./protocolbuffers.html)

- Akka Tutorials(from scratch)
  - [Introduction to Actors System](./akkatutorial.html)
