Hi, I am a post graduate student at Department of Computational and Data Sciences, Indian Institute of Scicences.
Prior to admission in IISc, I finished my graduation in Integrated M.Sc.Physics(5yrs) course at Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur. My current research is focused on Graph Theory and Spectral Partitions. During my stay in IISc, I have finished following courses(not necessarily in chronological order).

- Machine Learning with Large Datasets
- Machine Learning for Signal Processing
- Introduction to Scalable Systems
- Multigrid Methods
- Finite Elements, Methods and Applications
- Analysis-I
- Natural Language Understanding
- Scalable System for Data Sciences
- Numerical Linear Algebra
- Modeling and Simulation
- Numerical Methods

I write about deep learning(as a practioner point of view), scalable data systems, analytics, and my research work. You can find articles on various topics.
